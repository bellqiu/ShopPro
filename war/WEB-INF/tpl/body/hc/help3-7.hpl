Even standard size dresses are made-to-order for each customer. Therefore, if you want to change the size of a dress you can advise us this change by phone or email in 24 hours.There will be no additional charges. After 24 hours have passed, there will be additional charges involved in changing the size. Please contact our customer services for more detail.
